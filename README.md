Hi, I'm Rithvik Dhanpal 👋
=================================

Detail-oriented software developer with four years of experience building full-stack systems, REST API microservices, and data-driven applications. I enjoy combining solid backend engineering with practical AI and RAG workflows to deliver reliable, scalable solutions.

💼 What I Work On
-----------------
- Designing and teaching Java/Spring and Python labs at Montclair State University as a Graduate Assistant & Supplemental Instructor.
- Developing data-centric services that blend Java/Spring Boot microservices with Python ML pipelines.
- Exploring graph-enhanced RAG systems for learning platforms and knowledge management.

🛠️ Core Stack
--------------
- Languages: Java, Python, SQL, JavaScript/TypeScript
- Frameworks: Spring Boot, Flask, React, TensorFlow, PyTorch
- Data & Cloud: PostgreSQL, Oracle, MySQL, Neo4j, AWS, Databricks
- Tooling: Docker, Jenkins, Git, Linux, VS Code

🌟 Highlights
-------------
- Guided 200+ students through core CS topics while supporting Spring Boot course development.
- Delivered microservices for healthcare and finance workflows with robust RBAC and audit logging.
- Built analytics dashboards and ML apps, from PCOS early detection to global earthquake monitoring.
- Automated deployments and log analysis pipelines to keep systems observable and resilient.

🚀 Projects to Watch
--------------------
I’m curating repositories that showcase:
- Microservices and REST APIs with Spring Boot
- RAG pipelines with LangChain and Neo4j
- Data dashboards with Plotly Dash and Folium
- Full-stack apps with React, Java, and Docker

Stay tuned—featured repos and walkthroughs are on the way.

✍️ Teaching & Learning
----------------------
I love mentoring and sharing practical debugging, design, and version control workflows. I’ll be publishing sanitized lab materials, workshops, and notes soon.
